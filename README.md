## 📖 Overview

This project tracks **conversational coevolution** between humans and AI by analyzing dialog patterns through transition matrices. As users interact with AI, both parties adapt - creating a feedback loop that can be mathematically measured and predicted.

### 🧠 Core Concept

```
User ⇄ AI
  ↓      ↓
Pattern  Learning
  ↓      ↓
Endless Evolution
```

Traditional AI systems respond passively. This system **learns your conversation style in real-time** and tracks how both you and the AI adapt to each other.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Real-time Pattern Analysis** - Transition matrix updated with each interaction
- 📊 **Entropy Tracking** - Measures conversation stability over time
- 🔄 **Coevolution Detection** - Identifies mutual adaptation between user and AI
- 📈 **Visualization** - Network graphs and heatmaps of conversation flow
- 📄 **PDF Reports** - Personalized conversation profile generation
- 🧪 **Experimental Framework** - Validates Human-AI coevolution theory

## 🎓 Research Background

### Novel Contribution

This project bridges two research areas:

1. **Transition Network Analysis** (TNA) - Used in education research
2. **AI Coevolution** - Proposed in 2024 ([arxiv:2306.13723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13723))

**Innovation**: First implementation tracking personal conversation patterns as evidence of Human-AI coevolution using Markov chains.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conversation-coevolution.git
cd conversation-coevolution

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from coevolution import ConversationTracker

# Initialize tracker
tracker = ConversationTracker(
    states=['question', 'confirm', 'critique', 'meta'],
    learning_rate=0.3
)

# Process conversation
messages = [
    "What is a transition matrix?",
    "Can you explain more?",
    "Is this actually real?",
    "How does this work exactly?"
]

sequence = tracker.process_conversation(messages)

# Generate analysis
tracker.visualize_matrix()
tracker.plot_entropy_trend()
print(tracker.generate_report())
```

## 📊 Example Output

### Transition Matrix Heatmap
Shows probability of moving from one conversation state to another.

### Entropy Timeline
Tracks conversation stability - lower entropy = more predictable pattern.

## 🧪 Experimental Design

### Hypothesis Testing

**H1**: User-AI coevolution improves conversation quality
- **Measure**: Satisfaction scores, information retention

**H2**: Transition matrices predict future conversation patterns
- **Measure**: Prediction accuracy of M_t → M_t+1

**H3**: Coevolution converges to stable equilibrium
- **Measure**: Entropy trend analysis

### Validation Methods

1. ✅ **External Benchmark** - Compare with static AI baseline
2. ✅ **Diversity Metrics** - Track strategy variety over time
3. ✅ **Transfer Learning** - Test pattern persistence across topics
4. ✅ **Statistical Significance** - Repeated trials (n=30+)

## 🔬 Key Algorithms

### Exponential Moving Average Update

```
M_t = (1-α)M_{t-1} + αT_obs

where:
- M_t: transition matrix at time t
- α: learning rate (0-1)
- T_obs: observed transitions
```

### Transition Entropy

```
H = -Σ p_i log(p_i)

Lower H = More predictable conversation
Higher H = More exploratory behavior
```
